## Git Integration in VS Code

### Source Control Panel

VS Code's built-in Git support is accessed through the Source Control panel:

1. **Open Source Control** - Click the Source Control icon (âŒƒâ‡§G / Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. **Initialize Repository** - Click "Initialize Repository" or use `git init`
3. **Clone Repository** - Use "Clone Repository" for existing projects

### Making Your First Commit

1. **Stage Changes**
   - Click the "+" next to files to stage them
   - Or use "Stage All Changes" (+ icon next to "Changes")

2. **Write Commit Message**
   - Enter a descriptive commit message in the text box
   - Use conventional commits format: `feat: add user authentication`

3. **Commit**
   - Click the checkmark (âœ“) or use Cmd+Enter / Ctrl+Enter
   - Or use `git commit -m "your message"` in the terminal

### Branch Management

**Creating Branches:**
```bash
# Command line
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Or use VS Code's branch selector in the status bar
```

**Switching Branches:**
- Click the branch name in the status bar
- Select from the dropdown or create a new branch

**Merging Branches:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature
```

### Conflict Resolution

When merge conflicts occur:

1. **VS Code highlights conflicts** with colored sections
2. **Choose options:**
   - "Accept Current Change"
   - "Accept Incoming Change"
   - "Accept Both Changes"
   - "Compare Changes"

3. **Manual resolution** - Edit the file directly if needed
4. **Stage the resolved file** and commit

**ðŸ¤– Claude Code Tip:** Claude Code excels at resolving merge conflicts. Try: "Help me resolve this merge conflict" and it will analyze both versions and suggest the best resolution.

### Git History and Blame

**View File History:**
- Right-click any file â†’ "Open Timeline"
- Use GitLens extension for enhanced history viewing

**Git Blame:**
- GitLens shows inline blame information
- See who changed each line and when

## GitHub Workflows

### Repository Creation and Cloning

**Create New Repository:**
1. In VS Code, open Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P / Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Type "Git: Clone"
3. Select "Clone from GitHub"
4. Choose "Create new repository"

**Clone Existing Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

Or use VS Code's "Clone Repository" command.

**First Push:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Regular Push/Pull:**
- Use the sync button in the status bar
- Or use Source Control panel buttons
- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd+Shift+P / Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "Git: Push/Pull"

### Working with Remote Branches

**Track Remote Branch:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature origin/feature/new-feature
```

**Push New Branch:**
```bash
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

### Branch Protection Rules

Set up branch protection in GitHub:

1. Go to repository â†’ Settings â†’ Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Restrict pushes to matching branches

### Pull Request Workflow

**Creating Pull Requests:**
1. Push your feature branch to GitHub
2. In VS Code, use GitHub Pull Requests extension
3. Click "Create Pull Request" in Source Control panel
4. Fill in title and description
5. Request reviewers and assign labels

**Reviewing Pull Requests:**
1. Open GitHub Pull Requests panel
2. Select the PR to review
3. View changes inline in VS Code
4. Add comments and suggestions
5. Approve or request changes

**ðŸ¤– Claude Code Tip:** Claude Code can help write better PR descriptions. Try: "Generate a pull request description for my recent commits" and it will analyze your changes and create a comprehensive description.

### Issue Tracking Integration

**Link Issues to PRs:**
- Use keywords in commit messages: `fixes #123`, `closes #456`
- Reference issues in PR descriptions

**Create Issues from VS Code:**
- Use GitHub Issues extension

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. Authentication Problems**

*Issue:* "Permission denied (publickey)"
```bash
# Solution: Set up SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Add to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ SSH Keys
```

*Issue:* VS Code asking for password repeatedly
```bash
# Solution: Use credential manager
git config --global credential.helper store
# Or for macOS:
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

**2. Merge Conflicts**

*Issue:* Complex merge conflicts
```bash
# Use VS Code's merge editor
git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'

# Or ask Claude Code for help
claude "Help me resolve this merge conflict"
```

**3. Performance Issues**

*Issue:* VS Code slow with large repositories
```bash
# Exclude unnecessary files
echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
echo "dist/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore

# Use Git LFS for large files
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.tar.gz"
```

**4. Extension Conflicts**

*Issue:* Extensions interfering with each other
- Disable extensions one by one to identify conflicts
- Use VS Code profiles for different project types
- Check extension compatibility in marketplace

**5. Claude Code Issues**

*Issue:* Claude Code not connecting to VS Code
```bash
# Ensure VS Code is running
# Run from integrated terminal
claude /ide

# Check installation
which claude
claude --version
```

*Issue:* Claude Code responses slow
```bash
# Check network connection
# Verify API key is set correctly
# Try reducing context size
```

### Performance Optimization

**Git Performance:**
```bash
# Clean up repository
git gc --aggressive

# Remove unused references
git remote prune origin

# Shallow clone for large repos
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

**VS Code Performance:**
```json
{
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/node_modules/**": true,
    "**/.git/objects/**": true,
    "**/dist/**": true
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/node_modules": true,
    "**/dist": true
  }
}
```

### Debugging Git Issues

**Check Git Status:**
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -10
git remote -v
```

**Reset Operations:**
```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Reset to remote state
git reset --hard origin/main
```

**ðŸ¤– Claude Code Troubleshooting:**
When you encounter issues, Claude Code can often provide immediate solutions:

```bash
# General troubleshooting
claude "I'm getting this error: [paste error message]"

# Git-specific issues
claude "Help me fix this git problem: [describe issue]"

# VS Code issues
claude "My VS Code is behaving strangely: [describe symptoms]"
```
