## Your First Project

### Create a New Folder

1. Open VS Code
2. Click "Open Folder" or press `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O`
3. Create a new folder called "my-first-project"
4. Select it and click "Open"

### Create Your First File

3. Type: "Hello, world! This is my first project."
4. Save the file

### Essential VS Code Extensions

Click the Extensions icon (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`) and install:

- **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** - Work with GitHub directly
- **GitLens** - See Git information in your code
- **Live Server** - Preview web pages instantly

**ü§ñ Claude Code Tip:** Ask Claude Code to recommend extensions for your specific programming language: "What VS Code extensions do I need for Python development?"

---

## Working with Git

### What is Git?

Git tracks changes to your files so you can:
- See what you changed and when
- Go back to previous versions
- Work with others without conflicts

### Your First Git Repository

1. Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+`` or `Cmd+``)
2. Type: `git init`
3. You've just created a Git repository!

### Making Your First Commit

A "commit" is like saving a snapshot of your project.

1. **Stage your changes:**
   - Click the Source Control icon (looks like a branch)
   - Click "+" next to `hello.txt`

2. **Write a commit message:**
   - Type: "Add hello world file"
   - Press `Ctrl+Enter` or click the tick mark

3. **Done!** You've made your first commit

### Understanding the Source Control Panel

- **Changes** - Files you've modified
- **Staged Changes** - Files ready to commit
- **Commits** - History of your project snapshots

**ü§ñ Claude Code Tip:** Not sure what to commit? Ask Claude: "Should I commit these changes?" and it will review your modifications and suggest what to include.

## GitHub Basics

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is like Google Drive for code. It stores your projects online so you can:

2. **Publish your project:**
   - Click Source Control icon
   - Click "Publish to GitHub"
   - Choose a name for your repository
   - Click "Publish"

3. **Done!** Your project is now on GitHub

### Making Changes and Syncing

1. **Make changes** to your files
2. **Commit changes** (as you learnt earlier)
3. **Sync with GitHub:**
   - Click the sync button in the bottom-left
   - Or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "Git: Sync"

### Working with Others

**Clone someone else's project:**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Git: Clone"
3. Paste the GitHub URL
4. Choose where to save it

**Share your project:**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Copy the URL
4. Share it with others!

### Basic GitHub Workflow

1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Commit** with a clear message
3. **Push** to GitHub
4. **Pull** to get others' changes
5. **Repeat**

**ü§ñ Claude Code Tip:** New to Git commands? Ask Claude: "What's the difference between git pull and git push?" and it will explain Git concepts in simple terms.

## Claude Code Integration

### What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI assistant that helps you write and understand code directly in VS Code. Think of it as having an expert programmer sitting next to you, ready to help 24/7.

### Getting Claude Code

1. **Install Claude Code:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

2. **Start using it:**
   - Open VS Code terminal
   - Type: `claude`
   - Start asking questions!

### What Claude Code Can Do

**Help you understand code:**
- "What does this function do?"
- "Explain this error message"
- "How does this code work?"

**Write code for you:**
- "Create a function that calculates the average of numbers"
- "Write a simple HTML page"
- "Fix this bug in my code"

**Review your work:**
- "Is this code correct?"
- "How can I improve this?"
- "Are there any security issues?"

### Quick Start with Claude Code

1. **Ask for help:**
   ```bash
   claude "How do I create a new HTML file?"
   ```

2. **Get code explanations:**
   ```bash

## Next Steps

### Keep Learning

**Practice with a real project:**
1. Create a simple website
2. Track changes with Git
3. Put it on GitHub
4. Use Claude Code to help improve it

### Common Beginner Mistakes (and how to avoid them)

**Mistake 1: Not committing often enough**
- ‚úÖ Commit every time you complete a small task
- ‚úÖ Write clear commit messages like "Fix login bug" or "Add contact form"

**Mistake 2: Working directly on main branch**
- ‚úÖ Create a new branch for each feature: `git checkout -b feature-name`
- ‚úÖ Merge back to main when done

**Mistake 3: Not backing up work**
- ‚úÖ Push to GitHub regularly
- ‚úÖ Don't keep work only on your local machine

```bash
git status          # See what's changed
git add .           # Stage all changes
git commit -m "msg" # Commit with message
git push            # Send to GitHub
git pull            # Get latest changes
```

**VS Code Shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl+`` - Open terminal
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` - Command palette
- `Ctrl+S` - Save file
- `Ctrl+N` - New file
- `Ctrl+O` - Open file

**Claude Code Basics:**
```bash
claude "question here"           # Ask anything
claude "explain this code"       # Understand code
claude "fix this error: [error]" # Debug problems
```

### Getting Help
